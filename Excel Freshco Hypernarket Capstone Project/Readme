Freshco Hypermarket Capstone Project

Description:

This project delves into a comprehensive data analysis of Freshco Hypermarket's home delivery service, leveraging data from order transactions. The primary objective is to optimize customer satisfaction and operational efficiency by providing valuable insights into key business metrics.

Key Accomplishments:

Order Level Analysis:
Investigated order distribution across delivery areas and time slots.
Identified areas experiencing the highest surge in monthly orders.
Calculated delivery charges and discounts as percentages of product amounts at different granularities (slot and month level, drop area and slot level).

Completion Rate Analysis:
Examined completion rates based on time slots and days of the week to uncover potential patterns.
Quantified completion rates at the drop area level.
Analyzed completion rates in relation to the number of products ordered to identify any trends.

Customer Level Analysis:
Determined completion rates for various customer acquisition sources.
Calculated the customer lifetime value (LTV) for each customer.
Computed aggregated LTV for customer acquisition sources and acquisition months, following the provided example.
Derived the average revenue (product amount after discount) per order segmented by customer acquisition source and acquisition month.
Investigated potential patterns in order ratings across factors like delivery slots, number of items placed, delivery charges, and discounts.

Delivery Analysis:
Calculated average overall delivery times at different levels (month and delivery area, month and weekday/weekend, and individual time slots).
Analyzed any relationships between delivery charges, delivery time, and delivery area to identify potential causes for variations.

Excel Skills Utilized:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers.

Data Visualization: Creating charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) to visualize data and communicate findings effectively.
Pivot Tables: Summarizing and analyzing large datasets by grouping data into categories and calculating aggregate values.
Conditional Formatting: Applying visual cues (e.g., colors, highlighting) to highlight specific data points or trends.
